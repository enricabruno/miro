## MIrO

**MIrO** (Multimedia Inter-relation Ontology) is a formal model designed to integrate various ontologies used in the field of cultural heritage, including LRMoo, RDA, CIDOC-CRM, SKOS, HiCO, and CitO. MIrO aims to represent the domain of intermedial relations alongside the structured description of media products.

A knowledge base modeled using MIrO has been created to store descriptions of cultural objects found in *Il Giuoco dell'Oca* by Edoardo Sanguineti. Written in 1967, *Il Giuoco dell'Oca* is an early example of a *combinatory novel*, anticipating many of the formal experiments later explored by the [OuLiPo](https://oulipo.net) (Ouvroir de Litt√©rature Potentielle), a French group of writers and mathematicians known for their use of constrained writing techniques.
