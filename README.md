## Multimedia Inter-relation Ontology (MIrO)
<p>MIrO is a formal model designed to integrate various ontologies used in the field of cultural heritage (i.e. LRMoo, RDA, CIDOC-CRM, SKOS, HiCO, and CitO). MIrO aims to represent the domain of intermedial relations alongside the description of media products.</p>
<p>A knowledge base modelled on MIrO was created to store the description of cultural objects within <i>Il Giuoco dell'Oca</i> by Edoardo Sanguineti which was used as case study for the modelization of the domain.</p>
